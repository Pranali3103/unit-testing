# Unit Testing in Node.js

This repo is for learning unit testing in Node.js.

## Git setup (this repo only)

I use my personal GitHub account here, but I don't want to change my global Git username and email (which are set for work). So I use **local** config so it applies only to this repo:

```bash
git config user.name "username"
git config user.email "your-personal-email@example.com"
```

And then go to your github, login, create a repo with whatever name you want to and 

These settings stay for this repo only; your global (company) setup is unchanged.
